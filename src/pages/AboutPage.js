    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m Ellen, a software engineer at DoorDash, based in New York City. I first began coding the summer after my
      freshman year in high school and have loved it ever since. I'm especially
      passionate about writing code to address user-facing issues to best
      improve their experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I am not coding, you can find me at the gym trying to hit a new PR,
      on the volleyball court getting some touches, attempting to chef up a new
      recipe I found on TikTok, or following Duke basketball (gooo Blue
      Devils!).
